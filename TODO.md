# Changes/Updates
- Rather than using the "how many" variable, just
  keep the species, date, and lat/long. I will 
  just focus on observations, rather than the
  "maximum observed in a period" (that's a 
  little too much information for the use case).
- I'm not going to do the space-time analysis anymore. 
  Instead, I will be doing a species modeling analysis.
